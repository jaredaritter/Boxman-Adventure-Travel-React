                        <p>Do you dream of finally catching that big one? Are you looking to hike your way to the perfect stream, nestled among majestic mountains? Then this is the adventure for you. Our fly fishing package includes a guided fly fishing trip at the location of your choice. It could be that overlooked stream right in your backyard of western North Carolina, or something a bit further out for the chance of a lifetime to fish in Bighorn River, Montana.</p>
                        <p>It turns out when you look for some of the best places in the U.S. to go fly fishing, there are states you would not have expected to be on the list. Perhaps you want to go back to your original fly fishing grounds of Pennsylvania, or maybe you’d like to take a trip to Arkansas because you’ve never been and it looks absolutely beautiful.</p>
                        <p>Choices abound when it comes to fly fishing. Just pick the time and the location and you’ll have a guide, trip planned, and ticket to get there. You might just catch the “big one” with this birthday trip.</p>

                        <p>Make that pilgrimage to the homeland and take in the culture, sights, and history of Israel. We won’t sugar coat it, this is far away, but pop a Xanax and you’ll be there before you know it. Our tour service has offered specials on this travel deal before, but maybe the price just hasn’t been good enough. So we’re offering it one last time at the low, low, low price of anything you want.</p>  
                        <p>You’ll get history, great food, and guides with a rudimentary knowledge of how to get around. It isn’t Europe (our experienced guides learned that first-hand), but it is civilized and safe. Our travel experts couldn’t find any non-stop flights unless you leave from Newark, but it might be possible to fly with 1 stop Raleigh to Newark to Tel Aviv.</p>
                        <p>In Israel you can explore the Mediterranean coast of Tel Aviv and Haifa, wander the Old City in Jerusalem, and visit the rolling hills of the Galilee. As a relatively small country with only 6 hours driving from North to South there is much to explore.</p>

Whether you want to take it out for a day or a week, we can work it out for you. Coordinating with our very own privately retained captain we can sail up and down the New England coastline or meet him somewhere along the East Coast for a day trip.</p>
                        <p>The initial consideration for this trip was to plan a trip to a scenic New England town and plan to cross paths with our captain for a day trip out on the water. The whole family can be included as we settle into a quaint coastal town and take trips out on the water at our pleasure. </p>
                        <p>There are a few options here, but the theme is being out on a boat…</p>
