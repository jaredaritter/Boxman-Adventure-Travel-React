Our tour service has offered specials on this travel deal before, but maybe the price just hasn’t been good enough. So we’re offering it one last time at the low, low, low price of anything you want.',
      'You’ll get history, great food, and guides with a rudimentary knowledge of how to get around. It isn’t Europe (our experienced guides learned that first-hand), but it is civilized and safe. Our travel experts couldn’t find any non-stop flights unless you leave from Newark, but it might be possible to fly with 1 stop Raleigh to Newark to Tel Aviv.',
      'In Israel you can explore the Mediterranean coast of Tel Aviv and Haifa, wander the Old City in Jerusalem, and visit the rolling hills of the Galilee. As a relatively small country with only 6 hours driving from North to South there is much to explore.',
